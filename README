Provide a list of files to count the recurring triples
in each file: `scala triplecounter.jar <file1> ... <fileN>`
The counter also accepts streamed input from STDIN : `cat <file> | scala triplecounter.jar`

SBT 1.3.13 is also required, run `brew install sbt`

After both sbt and Scala are installed, execute `sbt compile package` to generate the triplecounter.jar binary.
